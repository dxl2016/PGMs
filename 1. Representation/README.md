## Models under uncertainty
## 1. Probability theory: declarative representation  with clear semantics
## 2. Reasoning/inference: conditioning and decision-making under uncertainties; exact and approximate; tradeoffs regarding accuracy in computation
## 3. Learning: statistical learning methods from historical data; parameters and structure; with and without complete data
## Graphic models: Bayesian networks, Markov networks
## Terms/operations: joint distribution; conditioning: reduction and renormalization; marginalization: produce a subset
## CPD (conditional probability distribution)
## Factors and scopes; big factors into overlapping scopes
## Factor reduction
## BN (DAG), causal/evidential reasoning in the stipulated models
## Flow of probabilistic influence through active trails (observed vs unobserved)
